The judge, who is usually the epitome of order and structure, is seen looking over the chaos with a mixture of shock and irritation. The joke relies on the unexpected and absurd nature of the scene, as well as the implication that the judge's decision to convict the janitor has led to this chaotic outcome. The punchline, \"This is what I get for convicting the janitor,\" suggests that the judge is now facing the consequences of their action, and that the janitor's punishment was more severe than they anticipated."}

This is a reference to a falling anvil, a trope from TVs/movies, where anvils fall and hit people on the head.

These safe,s are crushing things. The joke is that it doesn't rain safe,s in the real world, so this is a surreal and uncanny image.

However, the twist is that the raindrops are not falling from the sky, but rather crushing things, such as safes. This is an absurd and unrealistic scenario, as safes are not typically affected by rain. The joke relies on the unexpected and nonsensical juxtaposition of a mundane activity (looking out the window) with an absurd and unrealistic element (crushing safes with rain). The punchline, \"And tomorrow there's a twenty-per-cent chance of anvils,\" further adds to the absurdity and humor of the situation."}

This is an unexpected and humorous twist on the typical image of kings and their royal chambers. The joke relies on the incongruity between the expected and the actual, as well as the play on words with \"swayed\" and \"overthrown\". The punchline suggests that while the kings may not be able to be overthrown, they can still be swayed in their hammocks."}

One of the men, who appears to be happy, is staring at his watch with a smile on his face, while the other man is distraught and looks like he's on the verge of giving up.\nUncanny: It's unusual for someone to be so happy when they're in a life-threatening situation like being stranded in the desert with no food or water. The watch may be very precious to the man, as he's giving it so much attention when his basic needs are at such a low point.\nEntities: Watch, Mirage, Starvation.\nCaption: Maybe this thing isn't a compass, suggests that the watch may not be a compass, but something else that's important to the man, like a source of comfort or a reminder of home. The joke relies on the irony of the man's happiness in the face of death, and the unexpected twist of the watch being something other than a compass."}

This is an absurd and uncanny scenario, as cars are not typically found in therapy sessions. The joke relies on the unexpected and illogical juxtaposition of a psychiatrist's office with a car, which is not a living being capable of having a conversation or undergoing therapy. The caption adds to the humor by implying that the car is being asked for its own mental health assessment, rather than the more typical scenario of a patient seeking help."}
